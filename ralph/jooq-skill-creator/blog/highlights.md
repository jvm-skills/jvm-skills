# Processing Highlights

Noteworthy events during blog article processing — good anecdotes for the blog post.

- **#1**: First blog article processed! "Consider using JSON arrays instead of JSON objects for serialisation" (2025-08-11) — enriched existing doc-seeded `multiset.md` with internal serialization performance details (~80% speedup with arrays vs objects for 10k rows).
- **#2**: New topic file created: `array-operations.md` — "When SQL Meets Lambda Expressions" (2025-03-27). jOOQ brings functional array operations (arrayFilter, arrayMap, etc.) to SQL, with PostgreSQL emulation via unnest/reaggregate.
